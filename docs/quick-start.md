# Quick Start

Get harness running in your project in under 5 minutes.

## Installation

The PyPI distribution name is **`harness-scaffold`** (the name `harness`
was already taken on PyPI by an unrelated project). The import path and
the CLI binary remain `harness`.

### With uv (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install harness-scaffold
```

### With pip

```bash
pip install harness-scaffold
```

### Directly from GitHub

Use this if you want to track `main` or install before a PyPI release is
cut:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Onebyte1943/harness-scaffold.git
# or
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Onebyte1943/harness-scaffold.git
```

### From source (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Onebyte1943/harness-scaffold.git
cd harness-scaffold
uv sync
uv run harness --version
```

## Initialize a Project

Navigate to your project root and run:

```bash
harness init --agent claude
```

This generates the design-v3 footprint, organized into three layers.

> **Narrative language.** Generated playbooks, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the principle pack ship in **Chinese (`zh`) by default**. Pass `--output-lang en` if your team prefers English narrative. Structural items (section headings, YAML frontmatter, Provenance blocks, paths, IDs, `/hx-*` command names) stay English regardless — see [Advanced Usage → Output Language](advanced-usage.md#output-language).

### 1. The Brain (`.harness/`)

Tool-neutral core — playbooks, scripts, registry, the seed material agents need.

```

```

### 2. The Shared Contract

Cross-agent files that define the engineering process.

```
AGENTS.md                     # Agent operating contract (T13 schema)
.gitlab-ci.yml                # MR pipeline (verify + review) + scheduled drift
.pre-commit-config.yaml       # Calls .harness/scripts/sh/verify.sh --fast
.agent/                       # Cross-session progress log (lazy: .agent/progress.md)
specs/                        # Per-change artifacts (lazy, flat NNN-slug layout)
```

### 3. The Adapter Layer

Per-agent translation of harness commands into native formats. Both Claude
and Codex use the same `/hx-<cmd>` surface in design v3.

**Claude Code:**
```
CLAUDE.md                     # @AGENTS.md import + thin Claude-specific block
.claude/
├── commands/                 # 14 /hx-* slash command files
│   ├── hx-constitution.md
│   ├── hx-baseline.md
│   ├── hx-next.md
│   └── ...
├── hooks/                    # Available for verify-on-save, etc.
└── settings.json             # Permissions for .harness/**, specs/**, .agent/**
```

**Codex CLI:**
```
.codex/
└── commands/                 # 14 /hx-* slash command files
    ├── hx-constitution.md
    └── ...
```

## Verify the Setup

```bash
harness doctor
```

Expected output:

```
Harness Doctor — checking your-project


All checks passed.
```

Add `-v` to see every check, including the lazy paths that are correctly
"not yet created" right after init.

## W0 Bootstrap — First Session

After initialization, open the project in your AI agent and run the bootstrap workflow.

### Step 1: Synthesize Engineering Principles

```
/hx-constitution
```

Three-source synthesis: universal SDD principles + principle packs under
`.harness/principle-packs/` + the team's de-facto patterns inferred from the
codebase. Each principle is tagged `[enforceable]` (a hard gate) or
`[inferential]` (judgement). The result is saved to
`.harness/memory/constitution.md`.

### Step 2: Build the Knowledge Base

```
/hx-baseline
```

The agent builds the 7-document knowledge base under `.harness/knowledge/`:
`product`, `architecture`, `tech-stack`, `business`, `conventions`,
`glossary`, `setup-and-verify`, plus a `how-to/` recipes folder. Every claim
must cite `path:line` from the real code.

Pass `--depth L1|L2|L3` to scale the investigation (default `L2`). Use
`L1` for a quick survey, `L3` for high-stakes / legacy takeover. See
[Advanced Usage → Playbook Arguments](advanced-usage.md#playbook-arguments)
for the per-tier coverage gates.

### Step 3: Route Your Next Move

```
/hx-next
```

If you're not sure what command and flow level to use, ask `/hx-next`. It
reads the current state (recent commits, open specs, missing knowledge docs,
ADR gaps, verify status) and suggests the next move with a one-line
rationale. It writes no files.

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

```
/hx-verify
```

Runs the unified verification script (`.harness/scripts/sh/verify.sh`):
lint → typecheck → tests → test-honesty. The same script is invoked by
editor hooks, pre-commit, and CI — no two sensors can disagree about whether
the build is green.
